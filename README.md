Java Internship on Generic Specialization

My goal is to implement a solution allowing the backport of Generic Specialization from JAVA 10 to 8 (or even 7).

## 3 Main productions :
1. A specification of our solution.
2. A program capable to transform JAVA10 classes into JAVA8 ones.
3. A program to specialize the resulting code at runtime (by using some BSM and InvokeDynamic, to specialize).

## Internship road map
1. ~~[Read Interoperation between Miniboxing and other Generics Translations](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/210236/files/Thesis%20Report%20%28Milos%20Stojanovic%29_1.pdf)~~
2. ~~Write the Road map and Internship's context documents~~
3. ~~[Watch Brian Goetz on Generic Specialization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkpcuL1t1lY)~~
4. ~~Translate everything on a new github repository~~
5. [Read Compiling Generics Through User-Directed TypeSpecialization](http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/150134/files/p42-dragos.pdf)
6. Download the source code from Valhalla's workspace
7. Create an image of the JDK
8. Study the ORACLE's syntax
9. Resolve the question : " How can we treat the problem ? "
X . Patch ASM into JAVA 10 to read ORACLE's sources.
