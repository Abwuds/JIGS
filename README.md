# JIGS
Java Internship on Generic Specialization.

This repository was used for the internship of Jefferson Mangue.
The goal was to backport the **generic specialization** introduced by the project [Valhalla](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/valhalla/) for a futur version of the Java VM and Language to the Java 7 Language.

The project is now located in the repository [retroSpecialization](https://github.com/Abwuds/retroSpecialization).
